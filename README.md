## This is an ionic v4 app.
Once you've cd'ed to the app's location via a terminal, run using<br/>
<code>ionic serve</code>.

Or if you're looking to build for Android, run<br/>
<code>ionic cordova build android</code>
Find the app inside the <code>platforms/android</code> directory.

To build for iOS, you can "sideload" the app by running<br/>
<code>ionic cordove build ios</code>
Find the app inside the <code>platforms/ios</code> directory.<br/><br/>
You may need to install the ios platform by running
<code>cordova platform add ios</code>. If that doesn't work, run the same command with "ionic" in front of it.

Beyond that, reach out to me at eric.steinecke@gmail.com to push this up to the app store or if you need further clarification.
